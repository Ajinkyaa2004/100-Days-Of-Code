// Problem 3: Array Operations (Arrays, Loops)
// Goal: Work with one-dimensional arrays and loops.
// Tasks:
// Create a class ArrayOperations.
// In the main method, declare and initialize an integer array, e.g., int[] numbers = {10, 25, 5, 40, 15, 30};.
// Find Max: Write a loop to find and print the largest number in the array.
// Sum All: Write a loop to calculate and print the sum of all numbers in the array.
// Print Even: Write a loop to print only the even numbers from the array.
// Reverse Array: Create a new array and fill it with the elements of the numbers array in reverse order. Print the reversed array.
// Concepts Covered: Array declaration and initialization, array indexing, for loop, for-each loop (enhanced for loop).
