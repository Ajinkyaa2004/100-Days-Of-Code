// Problem 7: Bank Account (Interfaces)
// Goal: Understand interfaces and implementing them.
// Tasks:
// Create an interface named BankAccount with the following abstract methods:
// void deposit(double amount)
// void withdraw(double amount)
// double getBalance()
// Create a class SavingsAccount that implements the BankAccount interface.
// It should have a private balance instance variable.
// Implement all methods from the BankAccount interface.
// Add a check in withdraw to prevent withdrawing more than the current balance.
// In a main method (e.g., in BankApp class):
// Create an object of SavingsAccount.
// Perform a deposit, a withdrawal, and print the balance after each operation.
// Concepts Covered: Interfaces (interface, implements), Method implementation, Basic error handling within a method.
