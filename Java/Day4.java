Problem 4: Simple Student Class (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Constructors)
Goal: Understand the basics of OOP: classes, objects, constructors, and encapsulation.
Tasks:
Create a class Student with the following private instance variables:
String name
int rollNumber
double grade
Create a constructor for Student that takes name, rollNumber, and grade as arguments and initializes the instance variables.
Implement public getter methods for all instance variables (e.g., public String getName()).
Implement public setter methods for name and grade (e.g., public void setGrade(double newGrade)).
In a main method (e.g., in a School class):
Create two Student objects using the constructor.
Print their details using the getter methods.
Use a setter method to update the grade of one student and print the updated details.
Concepts Covered: Classes, Objects, Constructors, Instance variables, Encapsulation (private access modifier), Getters and Setters, this keyword.
