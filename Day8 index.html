<!-- Problem 8: Fetching User Data (Asynchronous JS - fetch, Promises)
Goal: Learn how to fetch data from an external API.
Tasks:
HTML Setup: Create an HTML file with an empty div with id="userData".
Fetch Data: Write an asynchronous function fetchUsers():
Use the fetch() API to get data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
Handle the Promise:
Convert the response to JSON using .json().
Once you have the user data (an array of objects), iterate over it.
For each user, create a new div or p element.
Display the user's name and email within that element.
Append the created element to the userData div.
Include a .catch() block to handle any errors during the fetch operation and log them to the console. -->
