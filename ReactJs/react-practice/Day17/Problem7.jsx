// Problem 8: Simple Router for a Multi-Page App (using React Router DOM)
// Goal: Understand basic client-side routing with react-router-dom.
// Tasks:
// Install React Router: npm install react-router-dom
// Create three simple components: Home, About, Contact. Each should just display an <h1> with its name.
// In App.jsx:
// Wrap your application with BrowserRouter.
// Define Routes for /, /about, and /contact to render the respective components.
// Create a simple navigation bar (<nav>) with Link components to navigate between Home, About, and Contact.
// Bonus: Add a "Not Found" route (<Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />) for unmatched paths.
// Concepts Covered: React Router DOM (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link), Single Page Applications (SPAs).
