// Problem 3: Basic To-Do List with List Rendering and State Updates
// Goal: Master list rendering with map and key, and managing arrays in state.
// Tasks:
// Create a component TodoList.
// Use useState to manage an array of to-do items. Each item should be an object like { id: 1, text: 'Learn React', completed: false }. Initialize with a few dummy items.
// Render each to-do item as an <li> element in an <ul>. Remember the key prop!
// Next to each to-do item, add a "Delete" button. When clicked, remove that item from the list.
// Add an input field and an "Add To-Do" button to add new items to the list. Ensure new items have a unique id.
// Concepts Covered: useState (with arrays), List Rendering (map, key), Event Handling, Immutability of State (when updating arrays).
