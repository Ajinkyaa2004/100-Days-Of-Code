// Problem 1: Simple Counter with State and Event Handling
// Goal: Understand useState and basic event handling.
// Tasks:
// Create a functional component Counter.
// Inside Counter, use the useState hook to manage a count variable, initialized to 0.
// Display the current count value in a <p> tag.
// Add two buttons: "Increment" and "Decrement".
// When "Increment" is clicked, increase the count by 1.
// When "Decrement" is clicked, decrease the count by 1.
// Concepts Covered: Functional Components, JSX, useState, Event Handling (onClick).
